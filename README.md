#### Change the way Elder High School's student website behaves.
### [Install this script from GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/395961-oncampustweaks) (Note: This is the master branch, not the development branch)

This is a Tampermonkey script that aims to fix some issues I have had with Blackbaud's OnCampus system.

> You can get Tampermonkey at [tampermonkey.net](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

This script **only** applies to [elderhs.myschoolapp.com](elderhs.myschoolapp.com).

### Current Features:   
-  Automatically hide completed tasks
    - By default, the assignment center loads all completed and graded tasks
        - This is just unnecessary information
- Automatically change to week view
    - This is a personal preference
- Button calculate unweighted GPA, and highest and lowest grades.

    
### Planned Features:
- Option to convert gpa to 5.0 & 4.0 scale
- Option to weight classes based off of names
